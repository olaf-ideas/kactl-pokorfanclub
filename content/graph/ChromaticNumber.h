 * Description: Calculates chromatic number of a graph represented by a vector of bitmasks. Self loops are not allowed.
 * Usage: chromaticNumber({6, 5, 3}) // 3-clique
 * Time: O(2^n n)
 * Status: Stress-tested
 * Details: This code does not compute the chromatic polynomial (as claimed by the cf blog). It computes the number of k-tuples
 * where each member is an independent set, and every element is included in at least one of them (possibly more than one).
